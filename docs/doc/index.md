times simple and intuitive. It is a colloborative work, with a full range of features
allowing easy implementation, and painless extensibility.


# Conventions
These demos use a good bit of pseduo-code - remember to look at the page source to
get the whole story.  Also, a few options are locked on for all of these demos, mainly
the control displays "inline" - that is, as part of the page rather than a popup
(the default behavior).
