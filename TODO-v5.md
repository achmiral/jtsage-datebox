# Refactor TODO:

offset.js is a mess

# "Done" files:

Everything needs love with docs and style.  This is a massive pile of "oh, just add this"

Finished-ish:
 - boilerplate.js
 - autoInit.js
 - baseObject.js
 - bootstrap4.js
 - bootstrap.js
 - calbox.js
 - eventHandler.js
 - shortUtil.js
 - slidebox.js
 - dateLimit.js
 - dateEnhance.js
 - widgetBinding.js
 - datebox.js
 - flipbox.js
 - dateFormatter.js
 - dateParser.js
 - offset.js (needs a re-write too)
 - public.js


# Frameworks:

 - jQuery (doubtful)
 - jQM (meh. likely)
 - Skeleton (likely)
 - Foundation 6 (mostly finished)
 - Bulma (very likely)
 - purecss (probably)
 

# Build:

 - there has to be a better way.

 Ideally, send all the files to the builder, frameworks seperate, have it loop through those.  so adding a new framework does not require editing the massive Gruntfile.

# Broken:

 - runOnBlur.  maybe.  need to look at what it's actually supposed to do again.

# Docs:

not even close.
